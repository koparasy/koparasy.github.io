When I was young I enjoyed breaking things and building them back sometimes unsuccessfully.
This process imprinted in me a capability of understanding *how things work*. 
This inherent curiosity followed me in my studies ([Computer Science/Engineering](https://www.e-ce.uth.gr/?lang=en)). 
Today, after receiving my Ph.D from the [CSL-lab](https://csl.e-ce.uth.gr/) and continuing for years to break up things, make them run faster and understand their internals I turned into a *generalist*
I can [develop code](repositories/) and [publish research](publications/) in hardware micro-architecture simulators ([Gem5](https://www.gem5.org/)), compilers ([Clang/LLVM](https://llvm.org/)), Parallel Programming (OpenMP, CUDA),
use Deep Learning Libraries (Py-Torch) and build complicated software ([AMS](https://github.com/LLNL/AMS)).
